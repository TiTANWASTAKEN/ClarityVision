If you'd like contributors to push their changes to the **`master` branch** instead of the **`main` branch**, while keeping the **`main` branch** sanitized and stable for releases or production, you can update your **contributing guidelines** to clarify this process. This is a common workflow where **`master`** serves as a working branch, and **`main`** is reserved for stable releases or deployments.

Here’s how you can update the contributing section in your `README.md`:

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! We maintain a **`main` branch** for stable releases and a **`master` branch** for development. If you’d like to contribute, please fork the repository and create a pull request **to the `master` branch**. Once your changes are reviewed and merged into `master`, they will eventually be merged into `main` for release.

### Contribution Guidelines:

1. **Fork the repo**: Create a personal fork of the project.
2. **Create a new branch**: Work on your feature in a separate branch.
   - Create a new branch off of `master` for your feature:  
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name master
     ```
3. **Make your changes**: Write clean, maintainable code, following the style guide.
4. **Commit your changes**:  
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add [feature/bugfix] - brief description"
   ```
5. **Push to your fork**:  
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
6. **Create a Pull Request**: Open a pull request **against the `master` branch**. Provide a clear description of the changes and link any related issues.

### Workflow and Branch Management

- **`master` branch**: This is the active development branch. All new features, bug fixes, and improvements should be merged here.
- **`main` branch**: This is the stable branch. Once changes have been tested and reviewed in `master`, they will be merged into `main` for production or release.

We encourage contributors to submit pull requests to **`master`** to ensure the **`main`** branch stays stable and clean for production releases.

### Additional Notes:
- Please follow the style guide and include tests for new features to ensure smooth integration.
- After review, your pull request will be merged into the **`master`** branch, and eventually into **`main`** when deemed stable.
  
Thank you for your contributions!

### Why this change?

- **Keep `main` branch sanitized**: The `main` branch is used for stable, production-ready code. By encouraging contributions to the `master` branch, you can ensure that features and bug fixes are well-tested before they are merged into `main`.
- **`master` as development branch**: This allows the `master` branch to serve as the working branch where active development happens.

By clarifying the workflow, contributors will know to work on `master` and leave `main` untouched until it's time to merge stable changes. Let me know if you'd like further tweaks!
